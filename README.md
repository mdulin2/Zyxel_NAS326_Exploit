# convert_uncompyle6
Within the amazing uncompyle6 project (converts .pyc to .py) I only saw a way to do one file at a time. In my research of the Zyxel NAS 326, I wanted to convert a large hiearchy of files. So, this is script for changing all .pyc files into .py files.   
   
All you need is to have Python installed, as well as uncompyle6.
